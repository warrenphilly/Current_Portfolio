            Greetings, fellow humans and AI overlords! I'm Warren Phillips, a 23-year-old software engineer with a 
            passion for turning caffeine into code and dreams into digital reality.

            When I'm not busy trying to convince my computer that it's not smarter than me (yet), I'm on a mission 
            to build the coolest, quirkiest, and most unnecessarily complex solutions to problems you didn't even 
            know you had!

        So, buckle up, fellow code enthusiasts! Together, we'll build, break, fix, and laugh our way through
